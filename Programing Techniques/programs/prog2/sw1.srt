1
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,543
Good day to you.

2
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,606
What do you want?

3
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,618
Boy, Get in here now!

4
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:04,818
What took you so long?

5
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,998
I was cleaning the fan switches.

6
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,787
Watch the store.
I've got some selling to do.

7
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:08,298
Outlanders. They think we know nothing.

8
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,009
They seemed nice to me.

9
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,042
Clean the racks...

10
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,534
...then you can go home.

11
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,459
Are you going to pay for that?

12
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,276
It costs seven wupiupi.

13
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,301
Is this yours?

14
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,498
Careful, Sebulba.

15
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,548
He's a big time outlander.

16
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:34,616
I'd hate to see you diced
before we race again.

17
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:39,323
Next time we race, boy,
it will be the end of you.

18
00:36:39,325 --> 00:36:41,915
If you weren't a slave
I'd squash you now.

19
00:36:42,975 --> 00:36:46,353
Yeah, it'd be a pity if
you had to pay for me.

20
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:11,069
Your friend is a foolish one, methinks.

21
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:12,160
You're such a joker, Ani.

22
00:54:04,775 --> 00:54:09,259
Better stop your friend's betting
or I'll end up owning him too.

23
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:26,798
You won't walk away from this one...

24
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,385
...you slave scum.

25
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:31,944
Don't count on it, slime ball.

26
00:57:32,625 --> 00:57:34,861
You're bantha fodder!

27
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:22,886
Welcome.

28
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,560
Begin the race!
